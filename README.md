This project is about planning the motion of a robot in a grid from a start point to a finish point
while avoiding the paths of two moving obstacles.  Otherwise, the robot dies!

How to run our program:


How to interpret the results:
On the graphical user interface (GUI), the room will be drawn as a set of squares, each with colors representing open squares, the robot, its path, the two obstacles.
